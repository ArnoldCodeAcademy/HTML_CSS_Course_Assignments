# Goal of this Repository
Build your personal & professional resume with HTML and make it look good.
Anyone can click a few buttons for a webpage, but web developers build their own, referencing their skills.

These are the assignments of my [HTML & CSS Course]() to sharpen your skills.
They are public to anyone, so feel free to accomplish them and build your own HTML Resume.

## Getting Stuck?
It may happen, that you have to google a part of a solution.
It is even conceptual by the tasks that you sometimes have to google.

### Why?

Because knowing how to google is an essential skill for your developer career.
Trust me, technology evolves, you can't remember everything.
Even senior devs (such as I am) google on a daily basis.

![Result Task 1](res/Result%20Task%2001.gif)

</details>

1. Create an animation that fades from `opacity: 0;` to `opacity: 1;`
   (I used `from` & `to` and a duration of `0.7s`)
2. Use the CSS tag selector of body to animate the entire content of the page

![Final Result](res/Final%20Result.gif)

</details>

1. Wrap the 'About Me' and 'Experience'-Section into `<div>` elements for easier apply of the animated classes.
2. Create an animation that starts at the end of the page animation for the about me section.
3. Add another animation that starts when the 'About Me' section is done.
4. Put the div element that holds the phrase 'I learn web development through' and the image inside the footer
5. Add a last animation that shows the footer once all other animations are done.
6. Change the section of why you want to be a web developer to why you've become a web developer

<details>
<summary>Hint</summary>

This is a tricky task. I suggest to have multiple animation with `%` instead of `from` & `to`.
