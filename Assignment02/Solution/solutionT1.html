<h1>Web Developer</h1>
<p>
    I want to be a web developer because I find it interesting, that the web creates itself.
    Furthermore I like to work from home, where I can watch both of my old cats. Lastly, I am not good at crafts
    so a keyboard is my ultimate weapon to create something from my mind.
