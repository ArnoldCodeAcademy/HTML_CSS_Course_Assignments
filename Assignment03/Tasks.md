# Goal of this Repository
Build your personal & professional resume with HTML and make it look good.
Anyone can click a few buttons for a webpage, but web developers build their own, referencing their skills.

These are the assignments of my [HTML & CSS Course]() to sharpen your skills.
They are public to anyone, so feel free to accomplish them and build your own HTML Resume.

## Getting Stuck?
It may happen, that you have to google a part of a solution.
It is even conceptual by the tasks that you sometimes have to google.

### Why?

Because knowing how to google is an essential skill for your developer career.
Trust me, technology evolves, you can't remember everything.
Even senior devs (such as I am) google on a daily basis.

The normal layout just smaller wouldn't look good. 
Try it by toggling the device bar in the dev console of your browser.
1. Create a media query class in your CSS file.
2. Adjust the classes '.flexContainerStyle' & '.flexItemAside' to match the result
