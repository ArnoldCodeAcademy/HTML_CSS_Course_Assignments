# Goal of this Repository
Build your personal & professional resume with HTML and make it look good.
Anyone can click a few buttons for a webpage, but web developers build their own, referencing their skills.

These are the assignments of my [HTML & CSS Course]() to sharpen your skills.
They are public to anyone, so feel free to accomplish them and build your own HTML Resume.

## Getting Stuck?
It may happen, that you have to google a part of a solution.
It is even conceptual by the tasks that you sometimes have to google.

### Why?

Because knowing how to google is an essential skill for your developer career.
Trust me, technology evolves, you can't remember everything.
Even senior devs (such as I am) google on a daily basis.

<summary>Hint</summary>

Remember how I tricked around with the cells for the game board.
You need to do something similar to achieve the result.

You will need [Pseudo Classes](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp).
You will also need the `>` operator to use inheritance.
